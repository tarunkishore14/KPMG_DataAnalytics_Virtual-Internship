# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

## Introduction

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is mainly divided into three tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
#### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

* Customer Demographic 
* Customer Addresses
* Transactions data in the past 3 months

Performed the preliminary data exploration using Microsoft Excel and identified ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

## Task 2: Data Insights
#### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

* In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach which we will be taking. 
* The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
* Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
#### Using visualisations to present insights

Developed a dashboard using Power BI that displays the data summary and results of the analysis.
